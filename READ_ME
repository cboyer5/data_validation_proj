USER GUIDE

Installation: 
Users must have version 3.10 or later of python installed on their machines. Additionally, the program can be run within a python IDE. Visual studio code has a suitable development environment for utilization of the tool. Within the visual studio environment, it provides a PowerShell terminal under tools > command line. This can be utilized as an alternative to the command prompt (cmd) which can also be used to run the script as well. 

Configuration:  
All custom validator files, YAML files, Spreadsheets and python code must be saved within the same folder along with a temporary directory folder to save the spreadsheets with marked error cells. 
Beware of the strict syntax and indentation rules for which yaml files follow. Improper indentation can result in errors and broken code.

Utilization:  To Utilize the tool, 
1st: CD into the folder/file path where all of the files are saved.
2nd: paste in or type the 5 required arguments.
1)	Python excel validator file (ex: python excel_validator.py)
2)	YAML config file (ex: Equiptment_validation.yml)
3)	Spreadsheet name (ex: 2747663_EQUIPMENT.xlsx)
4)	Sheet name (ex: Sheet1)
5)	File path to temporary directory (ex: C:\Users\E187276\OneDrive - Exelon\Desktop\Data_validation_code\tmp)
**The YAML file, sheet name and file path must be enclosed in double quotes
There is a 6th optional argument: (--errors=true) adding this argument will show a description of the errors in the terminal after the script is ran. Running the script without the argument outputs a marked spreadsheet with highlighted red cells but no description of the errors.
